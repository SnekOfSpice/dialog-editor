# Demos & Project Templates

You can find project templates on the [``demo`` branch](https://github.com/SnekOfSpice/dialog-editor/tree/demo). Remember that DIISIS is only the nodes needed to display text, so any UI and functionality will have to be implemented by you.
The demo project comes with a solid base for a visual novel.
