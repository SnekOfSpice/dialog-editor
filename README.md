# Demos & Project Templates

The plugin comes with a template to [create visual novels](https://github.com/SnekOfSpice/dialog-editor/wiki/Using-the-visual-novel-template). Remember that DIISIS is only the nodes needed to display text, so any UI and functionality will have to be implemented by you if you do not use a template. This also means that with more coding effort, you can integrate DIISIS  into game loops that are not visual novels.

# Big Editor

DIISIS comes with its own editor that behaves like a hybrid between plugin and standalone software. It runs in a separate window inside Godot and is packed with esoteric features!
