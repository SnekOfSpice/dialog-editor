## Connect your custom stuff to these events to react when DIISIS reaches new states, encounters issues, or generally does anything.

## Emitted when the instruction gets completed. Will be emitted on the same
## frame as [signal instruction_started] and [signal instruction_started_after_delay]
## if the instruction in question doesn't return [code]true[/code].[br]
##[param delay] is the time in seconds until [signal instruction_completed_after_delay] gets emitted.

signal text_content_visible_ratio_changed(
	visible_ratio:float

## Emitted when [method Parser.go_back] fails. This can be because the trail of visited line indices is empty or because the line type of the would-be previous line is non-Text.
signal go_back_declined()

## Emitted when [method Parser.go_back] successfully goes back to the last visited index.
