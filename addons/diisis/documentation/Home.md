Welcome to the DIISIS wiki!

DIISIS /daɪsiːz/ is a dialog plugin for Godot 4, currently being developed in Godot 4.4. It comes with an editor to create the dialog structure, and a lightweight and easy-to-use complementary LineReader node, which takes in the output file and displays it in your game.

This repository comes with a **[template](https://github.com/SnekOfSpice/dialog-editor/wiki/Using-the-visual-novel-template)** you can use to **create a visual novel without code.**

If you want to do more bespoke or complex things however, you will also find help in your endeavors here. At its core, DIISIS is aimed at developers that are comfortable with using Godot as an engine. If you have never created a project in Godot, I would recommend doing that first as you need to handle some (but not many) systems yourself that you might expect to be included in other dialog systems. This tradeoff comes with the upside of being able to be arbitrarily integrated into any UI or game structure you build.

> DIISIS is currently in active development and I am very disorganized. This wiki contains some features that are not part of the AssetLib version of the plugin yet, but everything that is written here is deffo on the [main branch](https://github.com/SnekOfSpice/dialog-editor/tree/main).

> Except for the obsolete stuff I haven't removed from the docs yet.
