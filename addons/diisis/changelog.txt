DIISIS 0.6.3 2025-09-13
the mid-noise jam hotfix or "well shit turns out there were a few critical bugs in that last patch"

General
- Clicking the button in the Godot editor now reliably opens the DIISIS window (and toggles between windowed / maximized view)

Editor
- fix closing tags not being recognized by text content
- The "update available" hint now is based on the state of the assetlib instead of github tags
	- If they ever change the HTML of their page this might break
	- Said hint now also opens the in-Editor AssetLib instead of the web page
		- Another thing that might break if the Godot *editor* is changed in layout in big ways
- "Go to function" search functionality now tries to open Godot's Script editor
- fix some data duplication leading to project fuckery

Runtime
- fix which parts of dialogue would get escaped for body_label_function_funnel around img and url tags
- With name style None, some references weren't needed but were still expected, causing errors. that's been fixed.
- fix actor lead time not initializing correctly on first dialine
- add custom_blockers

-------------------------------------------------
DIISIS 0.6.2 2025-09-08
NOISE JAM update :3 (+ the critical "oopsie references to addresses weren't getting updated anymore" patch)

General
- Improve docs in a few places
- Trim leading and trailing spaces when handling dialog args

Editor
- add HTML entity code completion
- fix inserting and deleting of pages not updating the "next" references
- make that stuff actually respect a page's address mode

under the hood
- When trying to set up the VN template, the plugin will now check if addons/diisis/[...] exists and just throw a warning if the files / directories don't exist (means you can safely delete the templates if you don't need them)
	- templates
	- templates/_meta
	- templates/_meta/template_setup_confirmation_window.tscn

-------------------------------------------------
DIISIS 0.6.1 2025-09-04
Oopsie it's the patch for a few small things

General
- Make a few functions private
- Add a hacky workaround to force the internal documentation to work (will be fixed with godot 4.5 afaik)

Editor
- Fix a bug in the LineReader find function where it'd add a triple "/"
- Add HTML entity support (stuff like &lt;)
- click on a fact item to go to its declaration in facts
- some window ordering fixes

Runtime
- Improved an error message in LineReader
- made LineReader.body_label_function_funnel skip tags

-------------------------------------------------
DIISIS 0.6 2025-09-03
This shit breaks compatibility on so many levels! Might as well be a new plugin! Also includes LONER_DOG additions :3

General
- Introduce text IDs
- Change to Godot 4.4.1
- option to delete dropdowns
- add ability to skip individual lines and entire pages
- clean up documentation, especially LineReader and ParserEvents
- fixes all around
- automatically check for updates (can be disabled in Project Settings)
- Refactor the entire instruction system
- InstructionHandler is gone
- numerous bug fixes
- better performance
- text export
- text import
- rubies
- LineReaderActorConfig as a new resource!

Editor
- Add text ingestion (raw text ingestion into text boxes and files at large)
- instructions:
	- add default args
	- dropdown arg limiters
- Option for Save on Play (true by default)
- Visual overhaul
	- General layout improvements & slimmification
	- Change editor fonts
	- Add option to collapse Conditionals
	- choice item views
	- incoming page refs
- fact deletion warning (if a page, line, or choice item contains a fact, this warns you of it. can be disabled in preferences)
- add editor menu
	- step through pages
	- editor reload
- Add option to be silly
- Add several windows
	- add actor search utility
	- Incoming references window for Jump Page/Loopback
	- add "fix punctuation" text option. Includes:
		- period toggle
		- apostrophes toggle
		- replacement rules
- more bbcode in hinting
- When going to a specific address, the specified object will flash (page / line / choice item)
- Less janky scroll behavior
- Add linearize_pages option to Pages window

Runtime
- name style prepend got a few more options and consistency 
- add ParserEvents: skipped, advanced
- add LineReader: virtual_choices, choice_pressed_virtual, chatlog_tint_full_line, text_content_word_wrappers, body_label_function_funnel
- rename and restructure some variables (most notably text_content is now body_label)
- Parser.reset_and_start got line index argument (ioydoy cameo)
- remove LineReader: property_for_name (was depricated) and inline_evaluator (merged with instruction_handler)
- (de)serializes the function execution state now. So even when executing a function, you can quit the game and just persist all the things
- Empty pages will now cause the Parser to go to their next page, and not return without change.

VN Template
- improve template by using _unhandled_input instead of _input, fixing a few input bugs
- add screen fade in / out
- tscn CG support (they have to be Control nodes)
- demo_script.json contains more info now
- text speed preview in options screen

under the hood
- remove chunks as a concept in line reader
- move instruction argument interpreting parser-side. this shrinks files down a bit and gets rid of a bit of code duplication since inline calls were interpreted at runtime already. regular instructions now just follow suit.
- give lines an ID. Isn't used directly but should help with tracking things throughout merge conflicts and is necessary for importing/export text
- some code cleanup in the plugin itself!
- change LineReader to inherit from Node instead of Control
- introduce generic subwindow to editor
