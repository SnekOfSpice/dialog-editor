-------------------------------------------------
DIISIS 0.6
This shit breaks compatibility a bit!

General
- Introduce text IDs
- Change to Godot 4.4.1
- option to delete dropdowns
- Skip line option
- clean up documentation, especially LineReader and ParserEvents
- fixes all around

Editor
- Add text ingestion (TextToDiisis) (raw text ingestion into text boxes and files at large)
- instructions:
	- add default args
	- dropdown args
		- including MULTI_DROPDOWN_TYPE_SEPARATOR
- Option for Save on Play (true by default)
- General layout improvements & slimmification
- Incoming references window for JP/LB
- fact deletion warning (if a page, line, or choice item contains a fact, this warns you of it. can be disabled in preferences)
- utility > step through pages
- silly.

Runtime
- name style prepend got a few more options and consistency 
- add ParserEvents: skipped, advanced
- add LineReader: virtual_choices, choice_pressed_virtual, chatlog_tint_full_line, text_content_word_wrappers
- rename and restructure some variables (most notably text_content is now body_label)

VN Template
- improve template by using _unhaled_inout instead of _input, fixing a few input bugs
- add screen fade in / out
- tscn CG support (they have to be Control nodes)

under the hood
- move instruction argument interpreting parser-side. this shrinks files down a bit and gets rid of a bit of code duplication since inline calls were interpreted at runtime already. regular instructions now just follow suit.
- give lines an ID. Isn't used directly but should help with tracking things throughout merge conflicts
- some code cleanup in the plugin itself!
