Along with DIISIS, you get some project templates that integrate it into their workflows.
Currently the only template is for visual novel-style games, with a focus on narrative that is communicated through text and 2D character sprites on screen.

To use the template, first create a directory in your project root (res://) called "game".
If you start from a blank project, you should then have res://addons/diisis/... and res://game in your project.

(Templates are located at res://addons/diisis/templates/...)
Then, simply move the contents of the template from the addons folder to the game folder.
For all tscn files in the autoloads folder, add them to your project's AutoLoads in Project Settings.

And you're good to go!

Note for people with more Godot experience: It technically doesn't matter where the template lives, as long as you adjust all paths in const.tscn.
